    <h4>I did a course called CS50's Introduction to Game Development from Harvard University's Open Course Ware.
      I watched the lectures on how games are made and how different features are implemented. Each game is paired with a project and the following are my implementations:

        <h2>Two Player Tic Tac Toe Using Socket Programming</h2>
        <p>
          Tic-Tac-Toe is a very popular game amongst people of all age groups requiring two players 
          and a board. The objective of the game is to have three marks in a row: horizontally,
           vertically or diagonally as two players make marks on the board, one after the other.
           <br>
           In this implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe on screen, p5.js is used to make the game, and
           Socket.IO with node.js is used to establish connections between a server and two users.
           One user acts as Player O and the other as Player X, and both players make marks on
           the board upon their respective turns. As they do so, the server constantly receives data
           from both the users and broadcasts it to ensure both players have the updated version
           of the board. An additional functionality added to the implementation is the chatbox at
           the right, which the players can use to communicate with one another.

        <h2>4 bit ALU</h2>
        <p>
        Features Implemented
        <ol>
          <li>The project implements a 4-bit ALU.
          <li>It is capable of performing addition, subtraction, and logical operations, namely, AND and OR on two 4-bit numbers.
        </ol>
        Methodology
        <ol>
          <li>Numbers are inputted via two 4-bit registers, A and B, which are implemented using D-flip flops.
          <li>Use of four full adders for addition and subtraction.
          <li>Use of 2x4 multiplexer for performing one of the four operations.
          <li>The ALU performs the selected operation on the two numbers and feeds the result back into Register A,  from where it can be loaded into the ALU again;
          <li>The registers are clock-synchronized.
        </ol>

        <h2>Unit Converter App made with Azure</h2>
        <p>
          Microsoft Azure is a popular cloud computing platform that offers a variety of services. 
          To explore some of these services, we developed and deployed a scalable unit conversion 
          application. The deployment of the backend uses Azure Function Apps, with the frontend stored
           in the Azure Blob Storage as a static webpage. 
           The Azure App Service plays a key role in managing the execution environment of the function, and
            Azure Application Insights allows constant monitoring of the application. 
            All of this was achieved using Azure Portal and Tools; and the following report outlines how these
             tools were used, the configuration steps, results, and insights gained during the project implementation.
